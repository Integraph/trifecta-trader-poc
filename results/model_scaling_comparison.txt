 and growth in services, the elevated P/E ratio and regulatory costs are significant concerns. Additionally, the below-average trading volume suggests institutional investors may be exercising caution.

Given these factors, I propose a HOLD position with specific risk management parameters:

- **Stop-Loss:** $250.00 (approximately 7% below current price)
- **Price Target:** $300.00 (approximately 11% above current price)
- **Position Size:** 10% of the portfolio

- Monitor closely for any negative news or changes in technical indicators that could signal a reversal of trend.
